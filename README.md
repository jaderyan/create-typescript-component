# Create Typescript Component

A handy little CLI tool made for completely selfish purposes.

Will create:

- Folder with component name
- .tsx file with functional component template
- index.ts file importing the component
- .scss file (optional)

## Installation

Clone the repo

Install dependancies

```
npm i
```

In the root of the folder run

```
$ npm install -g
```

This has installed the package globally and you can now use the CLI tool by running `component` in any repo.
